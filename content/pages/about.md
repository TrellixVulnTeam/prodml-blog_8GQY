My name is Niall O'Hara. I’m a Product Lead & Machine Learning Engineer at ChangeX. We are building a platform for scaling community movements that are improving our world. I’m passionate about working at the intersection of product design & applied machine learning to solve some of the biggest challenges of our time.

I have a background in Computational Physics and Engineering having studied at Imperial College London. I’m extremely curious and love learning through building, experimentation and online MOOCs. Currently excited about advances been made in the fields of Computer Vision & NLP.

I founded Machine Learning Galway in 2019 to build a community of people working on interesting projects in the city. We host monthly talks and workshops in applied Machine Learning. This blog is a means for me to explain the concepts I learn as I delve further into the world of applied machine learning & product design.

I love helping other people with projects they are working on so don’t hesitate to get in touch at niall@changex.org
